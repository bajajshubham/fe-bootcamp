# replicating tp quiz code

- This assigment is replica of tanay pratap teach <em> cli quiz app  </em> for lecture one.
- Here I done as same as taught and did not done even a single change.
- <em>CLI Quiz</em> is simple question and answers.
- There is three questions, it is like ask the question request for the answer and tell whether your answer is correct or not.
- There is also score, but everything is fancy.
